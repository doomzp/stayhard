stayhard:
    This is a simple script to count how many time you spend with your tasks
    or activites, the program is able to pause the stopwatch and to exit before
    the time reaches to the end.

    Arguments:
    * -T: Task you'll be working on.
    * -M: How many minutes you'll work.
    * -s: Summary of activities.

    If you use '-s' argument, the program will just print the summary, not
    start a new stopwatch even if you use the other arguments.
    To pause the stopwatch press SPACE key and same to resume it, if you wanna
    quit the program press ESC key, no worries, the time you studied is gonna
    be saved ;). THIS SCRIPT WAS CODED TO BE EXECUTED ON A GNU-LINUX MACHINE.

    Python dependencies:
    * tabulate: Print formating.
    * temios & tty: Set cbreak terminal mode.
    Those libreries are necessary to execute the program.

    Dedication:
    This is a special special dedication to Miguel, Diego and Jofre, thanks
    for all your advices and STAY HARD <3.
